## Local Dev Setup

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

1. Install the following:
    - [Node.js (version 20.11.0)](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal
3. Run `npm run dev` to run the site locally
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
